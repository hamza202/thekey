                        Islam considers sexual relations an essential human need which need not be
                        suppressed, rather satisfied in a proper manner. It is not something looked
                        down upon disdainfully, nor something from which a person should refrain.
                    </p>

                    <p class="bg-f0" data-aos="fade-up">
                        Islam has set certain laws by which an individual can both control and satisfy this
                        need. One is not to satisfy this need in an animalistic or lustful, uncontrolled manner.
                        The only legal channel through which this desire should be satisfied is marriage.
                        The ultimate goal of marriage in Islam is to achieve psychological and emotional
                        stability for both spouses. <em class="blue-color">Allah says:</em>

                        ‘Your wives are a resort for you and you for them.’ ArRabi`
                        bin Anas said, ‘They are your cover and you are
                        their cover.’ In short, the wife and the husband are intimate
                        and have sexual intercourse with each other….”

                        Islam safeguards the individual and society by forbidding
                        everything which can excite the sexual desire for
                        fear that a person would commit fornication or rape.
                        <br>
                        This of course would result in the proliferation of illegitimate
                        children who have no parents to raise them morally. They would then emerge
                        in society as a group who harbor animosity and hate towards others. Also, diseases
                        would spread throughout society.
