                        When Ishmael – son of Abraham and Hagar – was
                        born, Abraham’s other wife, Sarah, became jealous, so she asked Abraham to
                        keep them away from her. Allah, the Exalted, inspired Abraham to take them
                        to Makkah. He would visit them from time to time. Once, he stayed away from
                        them for a period of time, and upon returning he saw Ishmael shooting arrows
                        near the well of Zamzam. When he saw him, he embraced him the way a father
                        would embrace his son, and said, “O Ishmael, Allah has commanded me to build
                        a House here.” Together they erected the walls of the House of Allah. Ishmael
                        gathered the rocks and Abraham set them. As the walls were being erected, he
                        placed a stone where he stood and Ibraheem and his son supplicated to
                            Allah saying , O Allah accept from us, for indeed You are All-Hearing and All-Seeing.”
                            Muslims all over the world face the Ka’bah during
                            their prayers; it is the first House of Allah. <span class="blue-color bold"> Allah says: </span>

                        It is a symbol of Muslim’s unity. Muslims face the
                        Ka’bah with their hearts and bodies.
