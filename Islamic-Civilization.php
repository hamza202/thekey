                            In the fifth and sixth centuries the civilized world stood on the verge
                            of chaos. The old emotional cultures that had made civilization possible,
                            since they had given to men a sense of unity and of reverence
                            for their rulers, had broken down and nothing had been found adequate
                            to take their place. It seemed then the great civilization which
                            it had taken four thousand years to construct was on the verge of
                            disintegration, and that mankind was likely to return to that condition
                            of barbarism where every tribe and sect was against the next,
                            and law and order was unknown. The old tribal sanctions had lost
                            their power. The new sanctions created by Christianity were working
                            division and destruction instead of unity and order. It was a time
                            fraught with tragedy. Civilization, like a gigantic tree whose foliage
                            had overarched the world and whose branches had borne the golden
                            fruits of art and science and literature, stood tottering and rotted
                            to the core. Was there any emotional culture that could be brought
                            in to gather mankind once more into unity and to save civilization? It
                            was among these people that the man, Muhammad, was born who
                            was to unite the whole known world of the east and south.
