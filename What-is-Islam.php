                            W. Montgomery Watt in his book, What is Islam?, said, “Prejudice is only one
                            of the difficulties to be met by the European or American student of Islam.
                            As soon as he begins to describe Islam as ‘the religion of the Qur’an’, or
                            ‘the religion of the four hundred million Muslims of today’, he introduces a
                            category which does not fit the category of ‘religion’. For what does ‘religion’
                            now mean to the Occidental? At best, for the ordinary man, it means
                            a way of spending an hour or so on Sundays in practices which give him
                            some support and strength in dealing with the problems of daily life, and
                            which encourages him to be friendly towards other persons and to maintain
                            the standards of sexual propriety. It has little or nothing to do with
                            commerce or economics or politics or industrial relationships. At worst it
                            fosters an attitude of complacency in the more prosperous individuals and
                            breeds smugness.

                            The word translated as ‘religion’ is Dīn, which, in Arabic,
                            commonly refers to a whole way of life. It is not a private
                            matter for individuals, touching only the periphery of their

                            a way of which men are conscious. It is all-in-one theological
