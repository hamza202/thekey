                        After Abraham finished building
                        the Ka’bah, one rock was missing (in order to complete the
                        Ka’bah) so he asked Ishmael to look for a rock. He searched
                        and upon returning he found that his father had already inserted
                        a rock. So he asked his father, “O father where did you get
                        this rock from?” He said, “Gabriel brought it to me from the
                        Heavens.” And thus they completed the building of the Ka’bah.

                        ground and is set into the wall of the Ka’bah. The one who circumambulates
                        around the Ka’bah must make sure the Black
                        Stone is to their left.

                        while building the Ka’bah. His son Ishmael helped him build it,
                        by passing him the rocks.

                        As Prophet Abraham was placing the stones, his footprints
                        were cast on the very stone he stood on. Both Prophet Abraham
