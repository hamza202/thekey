                        Scientists explain the importance of mountains as being pegs which stabilize
                        the earth saying:
                        <br>
                        “Mountains have underlying roots. These roots are deeply embedded in the ground,
                        thus, mountains have a shape like a peg. The earth’s crust is thirty to sixty kilometers
                        deep, this being known due to the seismograph. Also, it is known due to this
                        machine that every mountain has an underlying root, which stabilizes the crust of
                        the earth with the underlying layers, and prevents the earth from shaking. Therefore,
                        the mountain is similar to a nail, which holds different pieces of wood together.”

                        Modern science attests to the fact that mountains are distributed evenly and
                        perfectly on earth, which also stabilize the earth, especially those mountains
                        which the geologists call “Asymmetrical Mountain Ranges” which are to be
                        found in every continent. How then could an unlettered man, whose nation was
                        mostly unlettered, know these facts?
