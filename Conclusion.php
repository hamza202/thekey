                    <p class="bg-f0" data-aos="fade-up">The Divine Religion, Islam, is complete in all aspects. It is the constitution
                        for a fulfilling life in this world, and an eternal and pleasurable
                        one in the Hereafter. You may find some defective manners
                        or faults in the way Muslims deal with themselves and others, but
                        know that Islam has nothing to do with these shortcomings. This
                        may be due to their ignorance of the religion, or weakness in their
                        faith which leads them to do what you see. So do not judge Islam
                        according to what you may experience from some of its followers.

                        researching the Truth. However, to further study Islam:</p>
