                        way of life. It has a complete code of ethics for a happy
                        life, as well as a peaceful and tranquil life after death.
                        Islam is free from all imperfections and defects.
                        Any deviant or abnormal behavior observed in a Muslim
                        should have no bearing on Islam, none whatsoever.
                        The reason for such deviant behavior is generally a
                        poor understanding of the faith, and in other cases,
                        weak faith that leads to the person going astray from
                        what is proper and noble. </p>
                    <p class="mt-3 bg-f0">
                        It is unjust and unreasonable for Islam to be assessed
                        or evaluated based on any individuals’ behavior or
                        attitudes, with the exception of the Prophet Muhammad,
                        who is the best example and role model for all humans

                        Every new release we at Osoul International Centre for Islamic Advocacy produce gives us a great
                        opportunity to interact with our readers. All our releases have the same overall objective,
                        namely presenting Islam to mankind, as it truly is. We wish people to be aware of Islam’s fine
                        aspects and profound teachings. We show clearly that it is the only faith that provides
                        practical and effective solutions to all the problems faced by humanity. It gives clear and
                        solid answers to all the questions that have troubled people over many generations, such as: How
                        did we come into existence and why do we exist? Where do we go from here? Furthermore, it is the
                        only religion that requires its followers to love and respect all the prophets God sent,
                        particularly Moses and Jesus (peace be upon them both).

                        Our releases also refute the accusations levelled against Islam and clarify people’s
                        misunderstandings of Islamic teachings.<br>
                        In all our releases, we take care to provide solid and
                        rational proofs for our arguments so as to give our readers the reassurance they need. Our
                        motive is
                        to make this great divine faith known to people. It is, by God’s grace, the fastest growing
                        religion
                        in our time, as confirmed by a study undertaken by the Pew Research Centre and published in 2015

                        This book, The Key to Understanding Islam, states from the outset that the Qur’an is not a book
                        of
                        science. However, Islam respects science and scientists, giving them high status in Islamic
                        society,
                        and tells its followers to afford scientists the respect they deserve. The author informs his
                        readers that he has no intention to relate the Qur’an to modern scientific discoveries. He only
                        cites Qur’anic verses that refer to such discoveries as science have made in our present time.

                        The book explains that Islam is a faith that lays down a complete way of life. It comprises
                        principles of belief that provide for genuine morality and promote the best aspects of the human
                        soul. It also comprises a complete system of verbal and practical acts of worship. Together
                        these ensure the pursuit of all that is noble at the individual level and strengthen social
                        unity. Clear examples of this are illustrated in the book. As such, the book gives a solid
                        foundation for a proper understanding of Islam.

                            While the way of life known as Islam continues as the world’s fastest growing religion - the
                            traditional underestimation of the Western Muslim population by western statisticians
                            notwithstanding - the availability of useful Islamic information that speaks to the needs of
                            both practicing Muslims, as well as interested others, has struggled to keep pace with the
                            expanding community. Ironically, the post - 9/11 frenzy that has gripped western societies
                            with
                            an often irrational loathing for global Islam has, simultaneously, piqued the interest of
                            more
                            inquisitive, pensive non-Muslim westerners. Their skepticism of mass media accounts of
                            predatory
                            Islamic “extremists” and “America haters” doesn’t match with their personal experiences of
                            the
                            Muslims they encounter in their neighborhoods, in their classrooms, or on their jobs.
                            Consequently, they seek the truth about Islam and strike out on their own to find answers to
                            questions that are either ignored in the popular media, or are given the familiar “spin”
                            that
                            underwrites misinformation. What results is an informational void that cries out for a
                            meaningful, serious response.

                            The Islamic revival that accompanied the removal of the yoke of colonialism by Muslims in
                            the
                            mid20th century benefited from a scholarship aimed at consolidating these new found freedoms
                            within the divine boundaries of the Book of Allah and the traditions of His Noble Prophet.
                            Indeed, the genius of these early Muslim sages helped to reconstruct the framework that
                            houses
                            today’s resurgent Islamic movements. But many, if not all, of these definitive Islamic

                            are written in a language and style that appeal to those who are already Muslim.

                            Al-Sheha’s Key, in one simply written volume, offers a wealth of information that is
                            revelatory
                            for the non-Muslim who seeks a clear and concise understanding of both what is, and what is
                            not,
                            Islam. At the same time, it provides a supremely well-organized inventory of traditionally
                            sourced overviews on faith, worship, and social issues for the practicing Muslim. Clearly,
                            this
                            approach to dispensing critical information on the life-affirming message of Islam presents
                            a
                            fresh and wholly inviting opportunity for presenting Islam while maintaining, immutably, the

                            worship, as well as the Islamic interpretation of astrophysics, with equal clarity and
                            balance. But maybe most importantly, it connects them all together with appropriate
                            references from the Qur’an and Prophetic traditions. The breadth and depth of the subject
                            covered is truly remarkable, and stands as a testimony to the sagacity of the author.

                            dialogue on religion in contemporary life. Al-Sheha’s The Key to Understanding Islam takes
                            its place among the most important works of its kind, redefining the contours of this
                            discussion while establishing improved methods for illuminating the Islamic underpinnings of
                            European science and culture. It is a seminal work that will hopefully influence the next
                            generation of Muslim scholars who share a concern and dedication to spreading the message of
                            Islam.

                            abrogates all previous religions. At the time of this publication,
                            Islam is the religion of over a billion and a half followers worldwide.
                            People are accepting it in large numbers, despite the fact
                            that the callers to Islam receive insufficient financial and moral
                            backing. Moreover, in comparison to most other ideologies, it is
                            uncommon to hear of a Muslim abandoning Islam after having
                            accepted it.
