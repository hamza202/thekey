                        The fact that the waters of the oceans do
                        not mix with each other has only been discovered
                        lately by oceanographers. This is
                        due to the physical force called “surface
                        tension,” wherein waters of neighboring
                        seas do not mix. It is caused by the difference
                        in the density of their waters. Surface
                        tension prevents them from mingling
                        with one another, just as if a thin wall were
                        between them. The Amazon River’s water
                        pours into the Atlantic Ocean and yet preserves
                        its traits even after it goes out 200
                        meters into the ocean.

                        It is well-known and affirmed scientifically that at extreme depths
                        of the ocean there is no light, only darkness. The cause for this is
                        that sunrays cannot reach it, for oceans range from being a few
                        hundred meters deep to being 10994 meters deep. The darkness
                        in the deep seas and oceans
                        is found to begin at around a
                        depth of 200 meters and below.
                        At this depth, there is almost no
                        light. Below a depth of 1000 meters
                        there is absolutely no light
                        penetration. Therefore, most of
                        the sun’s rays are absorbed by
                        the water at 100 meters. This
                        portion of the sea is known as
                        the luminous portion. Thereafter
                        1% of the sun’s rays are visible
                        at 150 meters, and 0.01%
                        of the rays at 200 meters.

                    <p class="bg-f0" data-aos="fade-up">
                        The ozone layer in the atmosphere reflects most of the ultra-
                        violet rays, whereas the clouds reflect 30% and absorb
                        19% of these rays. Only 51% of these rays reach the sea.
                        Between 3% and 30 % of the sunlight is reflected at the
                        sea surface. Then almost all of the seven colors of the light
                        spectrum are absorbed one after another in the first 200 meters,
                        except the blue wavelength.

                        <span>3.</span>
                    </h2>
                    <p class="bg-f0" data-aos="fade-up">Scientists have also recently discovered that there are
                        internal waves which “occur on density interfaces between
                        layers of different densities.” The internal waves
                        cover the deep waters of seas and oceans because the
                        deep waters have a higher density than the waters above
                        them. Internal waves act like surface waves. They can
                        also break, just like surface waves. Internal waves cannot be seen by the
                        human eye, but they can be detected by studying temperature or salinity
                        changes at a given location.

                        For example, the Mediterranean Sea’s
                        water is warm, saline, and less dense,
                        compared to the Atlantic Ocean’s water.
                        When Mediterranean water enters the
                        Atlantic over the Gibraltar sill, it moves
                        several hundred kilometers into the Atlantic
                        at a depth of about 1000 meters
                        with its own warm, saline, and less dense characteristics. The Mediterranean
                        water stabilizes at this depth. Although there are large waves, strong currents,
                        and tides in these seas, they do not mix or transgress this barrier.

                        This information has only been known to us in this age, with the
                        advanced technology and equipment available to detect these
                        events. The Prophet <img src="img/icon/7.png" class="moh" alt=""> lived in a desert climate far from the ocean,
                        and he did not travel across any oceans. The fact that the Quran
                        mentions this phenomenon indicates the veracity of the Quran.
