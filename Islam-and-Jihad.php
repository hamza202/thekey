                        One of the most misunderstood terms in Islam is “Jihad”. Unfortunately, the
                        word “Jihad” has been misused, and as a result many people associate it
                        with war and terrorism.

                        Linguistically, Jihad means striving for good or against evil. Jihad is expressed
                        in many ways, but generally it means resisting and opposing the
                        self from base desires. It can also mean resisting oppression, persecution or
                        standing up to a tyrant.

                        Jihad can also denote military effort. This is seen as a last attempt to end the
                        violation of rights of others or any act of aggression. Sometimes the sword of
                        justice is necessary to prevent the sword of tyranny as is the case with the police.
                        Yet even during times of war, Muslims are commanded to uphold morality.
                        Acts of torture are strictly forbidden, as is harming civilians, women, children or
                        the elderly during times of war. Furthermore, only a governmental authority can
                        declare a legitimate jihad, not individuals or groups.

                        Islam also prohibits the destroying or desecrating of places of worship, killing
                        or hurting of animals and destroying trees.

                        At the time of fighting between Muslims and non-Muslims, Abu Bakr, the first
                        Caliph after the Prophet <img src="img/icon/7.png" class="moh"> ,would advise his commanders saying:
                        <span class="hadeth">
                            “I command you ten things. Learn them by heart: Don’t betray, defraud (by
                        stealing the spoils of war), or break treaties. Don’t mutilate or kill women, young
                        children, or the elderly. Do not uproot or burn palm trees. Do not cut down fruitful
                        trees, slaughter sheep, cows or camels except for eating. You will also come
                        across people secluded in monasteries, so leave them and their devotions.”
