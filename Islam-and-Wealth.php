                        In Islam, all wealth is the possession of Allah with which humans are entrusted.
                        It is a responsibility which must be earned through permissible means and
                        spent in permissible ways, such as spending on one’s self and those for whom
                        he is responsible for, without extravagance or waste. The Messenger of Allah,
                        Muhammad <img src="img/icon/7.png" class="moh" alt=""> said:
                        <span class="hadeth">
                            “A slave will not be able to take a step further on the Day of Resurrection until
                                he is taken to account for [the following things]: his time and how he spent it,
                                his knowledge and how he used it, his money and how he earned and spent it,
                                and his youth and how he used it.” <small>(Tirmidhi)</small>

                            Righteousness is not that you turn your faces toward the east or the west, but true
                            righteousness is in one who believes in Allah, the Last Day, the Angels, the Book,
