                        Modern science affirms clearly that water is the basic building
                        block of life. Chemists have proven that water is a necessary
                        and active substance used in the reactions which occur inside
                        the body. For this reason, it is the only fluid which every living
                        thing needs, no matter how large or small it may be, starting
                        with micro-organisms to the largest living animals on earth.

                        The main source of life for humans, animals and plants is water.
                        It is proven by scientific analysis that the body of a human
                        adult from the age of 15 years and upwards ranges from approximately
                        50-75% water. As for a child, their body water
                        composition can be even higher. As for the plant kingdom, the
                        water content of common fruits and vegetables is as follows:
                        banana (74%), white potato (79%), grapes (81%), pineapple
                        (87%), celery (95%) and radish (95%). This shows how all life
                        is based heavily upon water.
