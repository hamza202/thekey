                        rights. Parents,
                        spouses, children, neighbors; all are given specific rights according to their
                        specific roles in this world. Accordingly, mutual bonds and solidity can be established
                        and strengthened between the individuals of a Muslim society. This
                        spreads love and unity and prevents the society from fragmenting.</p>

a guardian of his subjects and responsible for them. A husband is a guardian of
his family and is responsible for them. A woman is a guardian of her husband’s
house and is responsible for it, and a servant is a guardian of his master’s property
and is responsible for it.”

                        “If you must do so, then give the paths their rights.” They said, “And what are
                        the rights of the paths?” He replied, “Lowering one’s gaze (not looking at members
                        of the opposite gender), not bringing harm to others, replying to salutations,
                        and enjoining good and forbidding evil.” <small>(Bukhari)</small>

                        Even animals have rights. Showing them compassion and
                        treating them well is a means to attain forgiveness of one’s
                        sins. The Messenger of Allah, Muhammad <img src="img/icon/7.png" class="moh" alt=""> said:
                        <br>
                        <span class="hadeth">
                            “Once a man was tending to some business, and became
                                very thirsty. He came across a well, so he descended into it
                                and drank from it. [When he came out], he saw a dog panting
                                and licking the dirt (in search of water) due to thirst.
                                The man said, ‘This
                                dog is as thirsty
                                as I was.’ So he
                                descended [once
                                again] into the well,
                                filled his boot with
                                water and gave a
                                drink to the dog.
                                [Due to that] Allah
                                rewarded him by
                                forgiving his sins.”
                            They said, “O Messenger
                            of Allah, will
                            we be rewarded
                            even for our kindness
                            to animals?” He replied, “Yes indeed. Every kindness
                            to a living being will be rewarded.”

                        Islam has made mistreating animals, such as confining them
                        without food or drink, or torturing them, reasons for entering
                        the Hellfire. The Messenger of Allah, Muhammad <img src="img/icon/7.png" class="moh" alt=""> said:
                        <br>
                        <span class="hadeth">
                             “A woman entered Hell because of a cat which she tied up
                        and did not feed, nor did she let it loose to feed upon the
                        vermin of the earth.” <small> (Bukhari)</small>

                        If this is the mercy Islam shows to animals, how much more
                        mercy would it show to humans, whom Allah has preferred and
                        honored over all other creatures?
