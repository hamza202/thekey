                        Islam means to submit to Allah, adhere to obeying Him, and
                        be free from worshipping any others besides Allah. There is no
                        good except that Islam ordered for it to be done, and there is
                        no evil except that which it prohibited. Applying Islam guarantees
                        everyone to be able to live in security and peace in light of
                        its system, which safeguards rights for all.

                        virtuous society to implement and regulate a Muslim’s relationship with their
                        Lord, their community and the surrounding world – whether the human world
                        or the animal and plant kingdom. The whole of humanity is unable to produce
