                        unseen world, which only Allah knows. Human intellect is incapable of realizing
                        and grasping what the substance matter of the first creation
                        was, for Allah did not inform us about it. Humans can only

                        This verse makes unmistakable reference to the fact that Allah
                        created the universe from a single entity, and He is All-Capable
                        over all things. Allah then ordered this “single entity” to split,
                        which it did, and turned into a cloud of smoke. From this cloud of smoke Allah
                        created the heavens and earth. This is mentioned in the words of Allah:

                            attribute to Him equals? That is the Lord of the worlds.’ And He placed on the
                            earth firmly set mountains over its surface, and He blessed it and determined
                            therein its [creatures'] sustenance in four days without distinction - for [the
                            information] of those who ask. Then He directed Himself to the heaven while
                            it was smoke and said to it and to the earth, ‘Come [into being], willingly or
                            by compulsion.’ They said, ‘We have come willingly.’ And He completed them
                            as seven heavens within two days and inspired in each heaven its command.
                            And We adorned the nearest heaven with lamps and as protection. That is the
