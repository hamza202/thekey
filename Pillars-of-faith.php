                                Belief in Qadhaa and Qadar results in a clear conscience

                                about what happened or did not come to pass.

                                drive humans to seek a cure; this is done by searching
                                for the sources of medicine which Allah, the Most High,
                                created in this universe

                                fear of the creation. Ibn ‘Abbaas said, “I was behind the
                                Messenger of Allah <img class="moh" src="img/icon/7.png" alt=""> one day and he <img class="moh" src="img/icon/7.png" alt=""> said to me:


                                <span class="hadeth">‘O young boy, I will teach you some words: Guard Allah’s
                                commandments and He will guard you. Guard Allah’s commandments,
                                you will find Him in front of you. If you ask,
                                then ask Allah, and if you seek help, then seek help from
                                Allah and know that if the whole world was to gather to
                                help you, they would never be able to help you except
                                with something which Allah has already decreed for you.
                                And if the whole world gathered to cause you some harm,
                                they would not be able to harm you except with something
                                which Allah has already decreed for you. The pens have
                                been lifted, and the scrolls have dried.’
