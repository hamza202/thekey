                        Purity is a condition for prayer to be regarded
                        as valid, and prayer is an act of worship which a
                        Muslim performs at least five times throughout his
                        daily routine. Islam also requires that one wash
                        fully after ejaculation or sexual intercourse, and
                        highly encourages washing fully before performing
                        those types of worship which are manifest symbols of Islam, such as the
                        Friday Prayer and the Greater and Lesser Pilgrimage to Makkah.

                            feet to the ankles. And if you are in a state of sexual impurity, then purify yourselves.
                            But if you are ill or on a journey or one of you comes from the place
                            of relieving himself or you have contacted women and do not find water, then
                            seek clean earth and wipe over your faces and hands with it. Allah does not
