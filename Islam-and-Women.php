                        In Islam, men and women are different from each other and each has their
                        respective roles. Honoring and respecting women in Islam is a sign of a good,
                        wholesome character and an unadulterated nature. The Messenger of Allah,
                        Muhammad <img src="img/icon/7.png" class="moh" alt=""> said:
                        <br>
                        <span class="hadeth">
                            “The best of you are the ones who are best towards their wives.” <small>(Tirmidhi)</small>

                        ties with, and treat well. When a man asked the Messenger of Allah, Muhammad
                        <img src="img/icon/7.png" class="moh" alt=""> to whom he should favor with his companionship, he
                        replied:

                            “Your mother.” He said, “Then who?” He said, “Your mother.” He said, “Then
                        who?” He said, “Your mother.” He said, “Then who?” He said, “Your father.” <small>(Bukhari)</small>
