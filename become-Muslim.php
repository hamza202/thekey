                        that you need to perform, either in specific areas or in the company of others.
                        This is because, in Islam, a person has a direct relationship with his Lord without
                        any intermediaries.</p>

                    <p class="bg-f0" data-aos="fade-up">
                        By simply believing and declaring that there is only one God and that Muhammad
                        is His servant and Messenger, one thereby becomes Muslim. Upon
                        making this statement sincerely, every sin in someone's life up to that point is
                        forgiven.
