                        All these stages are mentioned in the Qur’an. One finds that this
                        topic which was discovered through modern science has been
                        mentioned in the Qur’an which was revealed over 1400 years
                        ago! This alone affirms the fact that the Qur’an can only be the
                        Words of Allah and that Muhammad received divine revelation and taught people
                        these facts at a time when no one knew these facts. In fact, these facts were not
                        known to man except after many centuries.

                        Astronomers have discovered that the universe is in continuous motion, and that
                        it is expanding. This was discovered by studying the galaxies and distant celestial
                        bodies. The American astronomer, Vesto M. Slipher, who studied the spectra
                        of galaxies, noticed that the spectral lines of a few nearby systems were shifted
                        toward longer wavelengths. This shift in wavelength showed that most galaxies
                        were receding from the Milky Way at several hundred kilometers per second!

                        velocity; that its recession velocity was proportional to its distance.
