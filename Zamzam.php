                        Abraham took Hagar and her son,
                        Ishmael, to a place near the Ka’bah. There, he left them under a tree at the
                        future site of Zamzam. No one lived in Makkah back then, yet Abraham left
                        them sitting there only with some dates and a small water-skin. Thereafter
                        he set out back towards his home. Ishmael’s mother followed him saying,
                        “O Abraham! Where are you going? There is no person whose company we
                        may enjoy, nor is there anything to take pleasure in.” She repeated that to
                        him many times, but he did not look back at her. Then she asked him, “Has
                        Allah ordered you to do this?” Only then did he turn back to her, replying,
                        “Yes.” She said, “In that case, He will not abandon us.” Abraham proceeded
                        onwards, and upon reaching a hill where they could not see him, he faced
                        the Ka’bah and invoked <span class="blue-color">Allah saying:</span><br>

                            Our Lord, I have settled some of my descendants in an uncultivated valley near
                            Your Sacred House. Our Lord, that they may establish prayer. So make hearts

                        Hagar suckled Ishmael and drank from the water she had. When
                        the water finished, she and her child increasingly became thirsty.
                        Unsure of what to do next, she saw her child in agony while he
                        cried. So she rushed to the nearest hill, which was the hill of
                        Safaa. She stood there and looked intensely, hoping that she
                        might see someone, but she could not see anyone. She then
                        descended and once she reached the valley, she tucked up her
                        robe and ran across the valley distressed, until she reached the
                        hill of Marwaa. She gazed attentively, hoping to see someone,
                        but she could not. She repeated this seven times.

                        Ibn Ab’bas said:
                        “... She ascended the Safa mountain and looked, hoping to see
                        somebody, but in vain. When she came down to the valley, she ran
                        till she reached the hill of Marwa. She ran between the two hills
                        many times. Then, she said to herself, ‘I'd better go and see the
                        state of the child.’ When she went, she found him on the verge of
                        dying. She could not endure to watch him dying and said, ‘If I go
                        and look, I may find someone.’ She then ascended the hill of Safa
                        again and looked for a long while, but could not find anybody. Thus
                        she completed seven circuits (of running) between Safa and Marwa.
                        Again she said, ‘I'd better go back and see the state of the child.’
                        But suddenly she heard a voice, and she replied to that strange
                        voice, ‘Help us if you can offer any help.’ Lo! It was the voice of
                        Gabriel. Gabriel hit the earth with his heel like this (Ibn `Abbas hit the
                        earth with his heel to Illustrate it), and water gushed out. Ishmael's
                        mother was astonished and started digging (to form a well around
                        the source of the water).”

                        The Prophet <img src="img/icon/7.png" class="moh" alt=""> said,
                        <span class="hadeth">
                             “If she had left the water, to flow naturally
without her intervention, it would have been flowing on the surface
of the earth." Ishmael's mother started drinking from the
water and her milk increased for her child. Afterward, some
people of the tribe of Jurhum, while passing through the bot tom of the valley, saw some birds, and that astonished them.
They said, “Birds can only be found at a place where there is
water.” They sent a messenger who searched the place and
found the water, and returned to inform them about it. Then
they all went to her and said, “O Ismael’s mother! Will you allow
us to remain here with you?” To which she agreed, and
thus they stayed there. <small>(Bukhari) </small>
