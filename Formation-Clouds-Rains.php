                        Modern science has affirmed the scientific points mentioned
                        in these verses of the Qur’an. The winds carry water particles
                        which are rich in salt up into the atmosphere. These particles
                        which are called “aerosols”, function as water traps and form
                        cloud drops by collecting around the water vapor themselves.
                        The clouds are formed from water vapor that condenses around
                        the salt crystals or dust particles in the air. Because the water
                        droplets in these clouds are very small (with a diameter between
                        0.01 and 0.02 mm), the clouds are suspended in the air, and
                        spread across the sky.<em class="tooltip-top"

                        salt crystals and dust particles thicken and form raindrops,

                                near the edges. These updrafts cause the cloud body to grow vertically
                                so the cloud is stacked up. This vertical growth causes the cloud body to
                                stretch into cooler regions of the atmosphere, where drops of water and hail
                                formulate and begin to grow larger and larger. When these drops of water
                                and hail become too heavy for the updrafts to support them, they begin to
                                fall from the cloud as rain, hail, etc.

                        A cloud becomes electrified as hail falls through a region in
                        the cloud of super-cooled droplets and ice crystals. As liquid
                        droplets collide with a hailstone, they freeze on contact
                        and release latent heat.
                        This keeps the surface of
                        the hailstone warmer than
                        that of the surrounding ice
                        crystals.

                        When the hailstone comes
                        in contact with an ice
                        crystal, an important phenomenon
                        occurs. Electrons
                        flow from the colder
                        object toward the warmer
                        object. Hence, the hailstone
                        becomes negatively
                        charged. The same effect
                        occurs when supercooled
                        droplets come in
                        contact with a hailstone
                        and tiny splinters of positively
                        charged ice break off. These lighter positively charged
                        particles are then carried to the upper part of the cloud by
                        updrafts. The hail falls towards the bottom of the cloud, thus
                        the lower part of the cloud becomes negatively charged.
                        These negative charges are then discharged as lightning. We
                        conclude from this that hail is the major factor in producing
                        lightning.<em class="tooltip-top"

                            From a scientific point of view, physiological notions must be called upon to
                            grasp the meaning of this verse. The substances that ensure the general nutrition
                            of the body come from chemical transformations which occur along the
                            length of the digestive tract. These substances come from the contents of the
                            intestine. On arrival in the intestine at the appropriate stage of chemical transformation,
                            they pass through its wall and towards the systemic circulation. This
                            passage is effected in two ways: either directly, by what are called the ‘lymphatic
                            vessels,’ or indirectly, by the portal circulation. This conducts them first to the
                            liver, where they undergo alterations, and from here they then emerge to join the
                            systemic circulation. In this way, everything passes through the bloodstream.
                            The constituents of milk are secreted by the mammary glands. These are nourished,
                            as it were, by the product of food digestion brought to them via the
                            bloodstream. Blood therefore plays the role of collector and conductor of what
                            has been extracted from food, and it brings nutrition to the mammary glands,
                            the producers of milk, as it does to any other organ.
                            Here the initial process which sets everything else in motion is the bringing together
                            of the contents of the intestine and blood at the level of the intestinal wall
                            itself. This very precise concept is the result of the discoveries made in the chemistry
                            and physiology of the digestive system. It was totally unknown at the time
                            of Prophet Muhammad and has been understood only in recent times. I consider
                            that the existence in the Qur’an of the verse referring to these concepts can have
                            no human explanation on account of the period in which they were formulated.
