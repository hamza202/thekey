                        two hundred years. Dr. Moore taunted, “Maybe fourteen centuries ago someone secretly
                        had a microscope and did this research, making no mistakes anywhere. Then he
                        somehow taught Muhammad and convinced him to put this information in his book.
                        Then he destroyed his equipment and kept it a secret forever. Do you believe that? You
                        really should not unless you bring some proof because it is such a ridiculous theory.”
                        When he was asked, “How do you explain this information in the Qur’an?”

                                        <p>Fertilisation: In humans,
                                            fertilization occurs when
                                            genetic material from
                                            a spermatozoon fuses
                                            with that of the ovum.
                                            In humans, fertilisation
                                            occurs in the distal
                                            third of the uterine tube
                                            (fallopian tube).</p>
