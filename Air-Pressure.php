                            So whoever Allah wants to guide - He expands his breast to [contain]
                            Islam. And whoever He allows to stray - He makes his breast
                            tight and constricted as though he were climbing into the sky. Thus
                            does Allah place defilement upon those who do not believe.<img class="q2" src="img/q2.png">
                            <small>(6:125)</small>

                        It can be concluded from this verse that the more one ascends
                        into the atmosphere the harder it is for him to breathe. This is due to the reduction
                        in pressure and low oxygen levels. This matter cannot be proven by anyone
                        unless the person ascends up into the sky! This fact was discovered only after
                        humans learned how to fly and reach heights.
                    </p>

                    <p  class="bg-f0" data-aos="fade-up">
                        When a person ascends into the sky beyond eight kilometers above sea level
                        they would encounter breathing problems due to the lack of oxygen and low air
                        pressure. A problem frequently encountered is hypoxia, which is a low amount of
                        oxygen reaching body tissues.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="bg-f0" data-aos="fade-up">
                        Another problem one may encounter is dysbarism, which is a complex of symptoms
                        resulting from exposure to excessively low or rapidly changing air pressure.
                        These two problems would interfere with normal body functions. Therefore, the
                        difficulty in breathing at high elevations can be explained simply as steps taken
                        by the body to protect itself.
