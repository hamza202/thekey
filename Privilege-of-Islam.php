                                Islam recognizes the previous divine revelations. On the other hand, Jews

                                Islam is the religion which covers both the material and spiritual aspects of
                                life. It does not neglect even the slightest of things in a Muslim’s life. It was
                                said to Salman, one of the Companions of the Prophet:
                                <span class="hadeth">“Your Prophet has
                                taught you everything, even how to relieve yourselves?" Salman replied, "Of
                                course, he forbade us to face the direction of the Qiblah while defecating
                                or urinating, or to clean oneself with his right hand, or to use less than three
                                stones, or to use bone or dung (to clean oneself).” <small>(Muslim)</small></span>

                                Islam is the religion for humankind at large, regardless of
                                their education, time and place. This is in contrast to previous
                                religions which were sent to specific people at a specific
                                time. For example, if a person wants to become a Jew, he
                                has to be born a Jew. Jesus said about his mission in the
                                New Testamant: “I was sent to the lost sheep of the Children
                                of Israel.” Whereas Islam is a universal religion that is fit for
                                all people, at all times, regardless of their race or language.

                        In these verses, God commands His Prophet <img src="img/icon/7.png" class="moh" alt=""> to openly call to Islam, so he
                        called his people to worship God alone, and to cast aside all false deities. He was
                        harmed by his people, yet he remained steadfast and merciful. He sent letters to
                        the Kings of his time and invited them to accept Islam. Among those whom he
                        wrote to were the Emperor of Rome, the Emperor of Persia, and the King of Abyssinia.
                        If the message of the Prophet Muhammad  <img src="img/icon/7.png" class="moh" alt=""> was not a universal one, he
                        would not have invited the rulers of different kingdoms close to

                        front with adversaries who were far better equipped and greater
                        in number. Why would he venture to do something like this if it
                        were not but a divine Message from God which he was ordered
                        to convey to mankind at large!

                        or a desert area will come to know of this religion, by means
                        of might or disgrace. Might by which Islam is honored and disgrace
