                        These are the places that Satan
                        approached Abraham when he left his wife and son in Makkah,
                        in order to make him hesitate from acting upon Allah’s orders.
                        He took a few stones and pelted Satan. During Hajj, Muslims
                        throw stones at these pillars, in adherence to the Sunnah
                        of their father, Abraham. They proclaim Satan an open
                        enemy who must be resisted. This is done by resisting
                        the satanic desires and obeying the commands of
                        Allah and abstaining from the prohibitions.

                        Muslims have two annual religious holidays. Eid al-Fitr is celebrated
                        at the end of the Month of Ramadan, and it signifies the end of
                        the Fasting season. The second Eid festival is called Eid al-Adha,
                        because Muslims seek nearness to Allah by slaughtering sacrificial
                        animals in adherence to the example of our father Ibraheem. He
                        saw in a dream that he was sacrificing his son Ishmael, and the
                        dreams of the Prophets are true. When he was about to sacrifice
                        his son, <span class="blue-color bold">Allah said:</span>
                        <em class="quran">

                            So We gave him good tidings of a forbearing boy. And when he reached with him [the age of] exertion, he said, ‘O my son, indeed
                            I have seen in a dream that I [must] sacrifice you, so what
                            do you think.’ He said, ‘O my father, do as you are commanded.
                            You will find me, if Allah wills, of the steadfast.’ And when they
                            had both submitted and he put Ishmael down upon his forehead.
                            We called to Abraham, ‘O Abraham you have fulfilled the
                            vision.’ Indeed We thus reward the doers of good<img class="q2" src="img/q2.png">
